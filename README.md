#Smart Kirana

Theme : Digitizing small industries
We've developed a tool for kirana stores in India. The billing data constitutes a pivotal piece of information providing the customer behaviour and buying habits which can be used to improve the customer experience as well as managing inventory smartly. Currently, the shopkeepers rely on their memory power to keep up with the demands and inventory.We are planning to add proactive analysis to that. It will lead to smart inventory management and will also help to reduce customer churn along with improved customer experience.

tl;dr 

* Smart Inventory management.
* Recommendations to shopkeeper about products that the customer will likely buy.
* Insights about user churn.

A test dataset has been generated by us using dummy data and machine learning has been applied using that.
